# pacman-maze

This python library should provided you with a virtual pacman maze.

I want to make it so that you can actually play the game if you want to, but you could also plug in different AIs and make them compete against each other.

The aim is for it to be as close a copy of the original game as possible.

This would involve:
- Game speeds up as the maze runs out of pellets.
- Human controlable pacman.
- Ghost with different behaviours and patterns.
- Hiddind place in the maze (as in the original game)
- Whatever other not-trivial

I always wanted bring something like this to a python dojo and get a lot of teams to write their own AI for it.
